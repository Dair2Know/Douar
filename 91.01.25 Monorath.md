### Obedience

To pay homage to Monorath, one must first seek out a large boulder or rock formation that stands alone in a clearing. This place should be bathed in sunlight during the midday hours. Bring with you five stones of varying sizes, each smooth and polished to a shine. Arrange the stones in a circular pattern around the base of the boulder, with the largest stone in the center and the smallest stone at the outermost edge. As you arrange the stones, visualize the rays of sunlight converging at the center, symbolizing the divine light of Monorath.

Once the stones are arranged, spend some time meditating on the teachings of Monorath. Reflect on the importance of selflessness, humility, and dedication in one's life. Consider how you can apply these principles to your own life and relationships.

Devotion to the teachings of Monorath grants the ability to cast 1 first level spell from the Protection and Community domains in the next 24 hours.

### Divine Gift
Sentinel's Refuge: The character receives the gift of _Sentinel's Refuge_, a small, intricately crafted wooden box adorned with runes of protection. This magical item can hold up to three charges of _protection from evil_ or _protection from good_ spell levels. Whenever the user activates the box, it releases one of the charges as if the spell was cast. Once the box is empty of charges it returns to a normal box until refilled by storing a spell.
