### Obedience

To pay homage to Monorath, one must first seek out a large boulder or rock formation that stands alone in a clearing. This place should be bathed in sunlight during the midday hours. Bring with you five stones of varying sizes, each smooth and polished to a shine. Arrange the stones in a circular pattern around the base of the boulder, with the largest stone in the center and the smallest stone at the outermost edge. As you arrange the stones, visualize the rays of sunlight converging at the center, symbolizing the divine light of Monorath.

Once the stones are arranged, spend some time meditating on the teachings of Monorath. Reflect on the importance of selflessness, humility, and dedication in one's life. Consider how you can apply these principles to your own life and relationships.

Devotion to the teachings of Monorath grants the ability to cast 1 first level spell from the Protection and Community domains in the next 24 hours.

### Divine Gift
Sentinel's Refuge: The character receives the gift of _Sentinel's Refuge_, a small, intricately crafted wooden box adorned with runes of protection. This magical item can hold up to three charges of _protection from evil_ or _protection from good_ spell levels. Whenever the user activates the box, it releases one of the charges as if the spell was cast. Once the box is empty of charges it returns to a normal box until refilled by storing a spell.

**1: Family's Bond (Sp)** _cure light wounds_ 3/day, _shield other_ 2/day, or _prayer_ 1/day  
**2: Twin Fang (Ex)** Once per day as a standard action, you can summon an exact double of your animal companion. The double acts and thinks like your animal companion in every way, and obeys your commands just as the original would. Your original animal companion and its double understand and trust each other perfectly. The double remains for 1 round for every Hit Die you possess, and then vanishes. If you don’t have an animal companion, you instead gain the ability to use _summon nature’s ally V_ as a spell-like ability once per day.  
**3: Faithful Archer (Ex)** You are particularly skilled at using Erastil’s favored weapon. When using a longbow, you add your Wisdom bonus on attack and damage rolls against targets within 30 feet.
